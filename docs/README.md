# Journal Bases Documentation

Navigate and manage your journal and periodic reviews with purpose-built Base views.

## What is Journal Bases?

Journal Bases is an Obsidian plugin that provides two custom Base view types for journaling and periodic reviews. It supports daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly notes.

## Why This Plugin?

Journaling and periodic reviews are powerful practices for personal growth, but they require discipline:

1. **Review daily notes once a week** to extract key learnings and create a weekly note
2. **Review weekly notes once a month** to create a monthly note
3. **Review monthly notes once a quarter** to create a quarterly note
4. **Review quarterly notes once a year** to create a yearly note

At year's end, you have a single yearly note summarizing achievements, mistakes, and learnings.

## The Two Views
